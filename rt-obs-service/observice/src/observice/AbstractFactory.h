* @brief This is an example class.
*
* This comment block is @e required for all class declarations.
* Please remove comments that are bracketed by [..]. These comments are there 
* to provide instructions to developers while writing their code. 
* Obvious member variables and functions, such as get and set routines and 
* default constructors and destructors, should not be documented as this 
* clutters the files. Use standard C++ comments for those comments you wish 
* Doxygen to ignore. If the class has many members - you may consider 
* providing separate public, protected, private sections for member functions
* and member variables to improve readability. In addition it may be useful to
* form member groups preceded by a header as shown below.
*
* Please note that the \$Header\$ keyword specified below is a RCS keyword, 
* and will inflate into the version, name, etc for this file.
*
